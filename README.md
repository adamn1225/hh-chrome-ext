## Storage Justification

Our extension, "Heavy Construct - Haul Quotes," requires the storage permission to save user preferences and settings locally. This allows users to customize their experience and retain their settings across sessions. Specifically, we use the storage permission to:

Save user-selected options for haul rate calculations.
Cache data to improve performance and reduce the need for repeated network requests.
By using the storage permission, we ensure that users have a seamless and personalized experience with our extension.
